pip command 
modules are something that we use to borrow some code 
sklearn machinelearning library in python 
print("hi) 
hashlib is an example of builtit module 
pandas and tensor flow example of external modules 
program down below that i learnt today 

print ("hello i m learning python ")
aise he seekh raha hu wapis se sab kuch ab dekhte hai kya hota hai sab bhul gya hu wapis se seekhenge pura course complete krta hu python ka 
comments in python # now whatever will be written in here will be commented thats it that is comments in python 
using control plus forward slash you can mark multiple lines as comments in pyhton 
''' and """ are also multi line comments in python 
backslash is an escape sequence character in python 
print ("hey "hey "and end") #now this would be error because the intrpreter woundnt be able to read the douible quote so thats why we use an escape sequence sequence character and that is baclslash 
print("hey\ "hey"\ and end ") now this will print the double quotes in our code oki 

now lets learn variables what are they and all 
so variables are something that stores data inside the memory like a container 
holds data in memory 
built in data types in python 
1 numerical data like int float and complex 
2 text data like string "abc"
3 boolean data it is simple yes and no stoes only 2 variable true and false 
4 sequenced data like list and tupple list are mutable and tupples are immutable 
5 mapped data "dict" dictionary data code = dict1= {" name ": "sakshi", "age": 20 , "canvote": True} 
note : in python everything is an object { this may not be in your grasp right now but once we will study about oops then you will get to know what objects and classes are there in pyhthon }

operators in python 
arithematic operators are : addition + subtraction - multiplication * exponential ** division / modulus % floor division //
thats it for today 
see you in the next one 
now we will make a calculator in python in the next one chlo dekhte hai kya hota hai
