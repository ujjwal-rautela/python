# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal Python learning journey!  
This repository contains all the code, scripts, and problem-solving practice I’ve done while learning Python — 
from the basics to intermediate concepts, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python.


## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ Core Python Fundamentals  
  (variables, loops, functions, data types, etc.)
- 🧩 Problem-solving practice  
  (LeetCode, HackerRank, logic building)
- 🔄 Daily mini-projects and scripts  
  (file automation, calculators, games, etc.)
- 🧠 Notes, code snippets, and experiment files


## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I’m documenting my 50-day Python + DSA plan to:
- Strengthen my fundamentals
- Build useful coding habits
- Prepare for job interviews and off-campus placements
- Work towards automation projects and portfolio-worthy scripts

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.0 
- VS Code / Replit / Jupyter (varies by day)  
- Git for version control  
- Markdown for notes
- Replit 

## 📅 Progress Tracker
