type casting in python
lets see we have written a is 1 and b is 2 and then we print a +b 
then python will write 12 not 3 because python will see it as string value not as numerical value 
so typecasting is generally the conversion of one data type in another in pyhton is typecasting 
the strings should be a valid integer or like that 
typecasting is also of 2 type implicit and explicit 

lets give input to python program --

a= input('enter your no")
print("my name ",a)
result will be a what will we write 
python concatenate too so we have to define variable if wee dont want concatenaton to happen 

so no next strings 
anything that u encloses on single and double quotations is considered as string 
  its essentially a sequence or array of textured data 
if we have to print big data in it or like multi line strings 
so it is something like commment eol error end of line error will be there 
triple double or single quote in first and last line will be printed whole
now indexing in python if i print ujjwal like this 
name ='ujjwal'
print(name[o])
so 0 will be u 
it will be like u=0 j=1 j=2 w=3 a=4 l= 5 if i will try printinh 6 value of index then it will show index error 
string slicing 
a='ujjwal'
ab=len(a)
print(ab)
it will show 6 as output
print(a[0:4])
ujjw will be the output 0 1 2 3 index numbers will be printed there 
string are immmutable 
a="ujjwal !!!"
print(len(a))
print(a)
print(a.upper()) #changes it into uppercase
print(a.lower()) #changes it into lowercse
print(a.rstrip('!'))  #it will strip away all exclamation marks 
print(a.replace('ujjwal','jhonny')) #self explanatory
print(a.split())#splits it 2 types 
there are many type of these all are not that important i think so
